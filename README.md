<details><summary> Abstract Factory </summary>
The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. </br>
<h4> Abstract Factory - Restaurant example </h4>
The Abstract Factory restaurant can create only two types of meals, Italian and American. Each meal consists of a dish and drink. </br>
When a client orders a meal from a certain cuisine type, he should get a drink and a dish, both from the same cuisine type he chooses.
